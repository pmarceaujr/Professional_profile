            Welcome to my on-line professional profile.</br></br>
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm a customer-driven and detail-oriented technical engineer equipped with over 10 years of progressive technology, 
            development, scripting, network  and database experience; delivering exceptional software implementation and optimization 
            projects on time and under budget. Offer significant expertise implementing SaaS applications and SQL databases, coding, 
            testing, deploying and troubleshooting software. Possess unique talent for liaising with clients, understanding complex 
            intricacies of technical operating environments, and developing new solutions to improve existing operations with minimal

          </p>
          <p>
            Over the past year I have been expanding my skills in web development and although I have been working with web technologies such as HTML, 
            CSS and JavaScript for over 10 years, I welcome the opportunity to expand even further.  Moreover, I still have a passion for doing development 
            on the web and that has driven me to continue learning and expanding my skill set.</br></br>  Below you will find my extensive work history and links
            to some of the small personal projects I have worked on.  I will be adding more projects as time permits.  Unfortunately, my larger Professional projects require
            user accounts and passwords to access them; however, the projects that I will be listing here are a reflection of the things I have learned over the years.
